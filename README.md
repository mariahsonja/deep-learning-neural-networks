### Overview

Deep learning is a term to describe certain types of **neural networks** and related algorithms that consume often very raw input data. 
The process involves sending data through many layers of nonlinear transformations in order to calculate a target output.

Deep learning has been used successfully in many applications, and is considered to be one of the most cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques. 
The associated algorithms are often used for supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning problems.

Neural networks and deep learning provide the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

### This Repo

In this repository I added a collection of jupyter notebooks with 
examples of Deep Learning Neural Networks models for *classification*, *regression*, 
*image processing* and using **TensorFlow**.


**It contains**

- `data` sample data used in the models
- `notebooks` jupyter notebooks with deep learning models examples 

**For IMDB Dataset, please, download it [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).**

**For more examples of natural language processing using Tensorflow, please, visit my [NLP repo](https://github.com/mariahsonja/natural-language-processing/tree/main/tensorFlow/neural-network).**

*This collection of Jupyter Notebooks came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years. They are all updated to be used with `Python 3.7`.*
